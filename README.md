Contents:

Machine Learning:

A24(Articlestydy24): A study on various car manufacturer articles around globe. study includes first_registration_year of car manufcaturer, article published date, deleted_date, stock_days in internet, search_views, detail_views, zip_code and product_tier... two different machine learning models are created to predict the detail_views and product_tier based on existing data provided.
tools: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, plotly,  




Data Analysis and Visualisation:

Python:

A24: Analysis of produc_tier and zip_code of article viewers in internet and its response to detail views.
Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis: Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.

Tools: Pandas, numpy , Seaborn and Matplotlib



ML with linear Regression: Using linear Regression to predict detail_views in A24 poject.
ML with Random_Forest: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
